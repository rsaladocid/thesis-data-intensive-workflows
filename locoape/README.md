## Abstract 
The field of educational data mining (EDM) has benefited from the abundance of data generated by educational activities. However, the effective use of this data requires expertise in data preprocessing and machine learning techniques. To support educators in this aspect, we introduce LoCoAPe: a low-code tool for the application of EDM methods for predicting student performance. LoCoAPe employs a workflow architecture that integrates Weka algorithms, offering both pre-defined workflows while also allowing educators to visually construct their own. Our experiments illustrate the adaptability and potential of LoCoAPe in assisting educators and researchers with varying levels of expertise.

## Software description

LoCoAPe is a user-friendly low-code tool that grants teachers and educational administrators direct access to EDM methods focused on predicting student performance. It operates based on the concept of workflows, which are sequences of operations involving data preprocessing, ML methods, and outcome visualization. Users can combine and connect these operations in various ways, allowing for predefined workflows as well as user-defined ones.

### Early predict pass or fail (REQ3) - Data expert view

In this case study, the data expert has to work with the Science Course dataset for academic performance prediction, according to the procedures outlined by Injadat et al. The authors define two prediction moments: the 20% stage, based on the scores of the first quiz and the first assignment, and the 50% stage, which includes an additional assignment and the midterm exam. The Predict Passes and Fails - Early workflow is used in combination with preprocessing operations to remove data and balance the dataset, and the classifier is modified to Naive Bayes, one of the algorithms analyzed in the original paper.

#### Datasets: 

[Historical/Begin](./case-studies/req3_2/data/science_course_historical_begin.csv), [Historical/Middle](./case-studies/req3_2/data/science_course_historical_middle.csv), [Target/Begin](./case-studies/req3_2/data/science_course_target_begin.csv), [Target/Middle](./case-studies/req3_2/data/science_course_target_middle.csv)
